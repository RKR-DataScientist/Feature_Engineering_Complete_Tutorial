What is Data Preprocessing
why is data preprocessing is important
= incomplete
= noisy
=inconsitent
=duplicate
ML algo for preprocessing
=GIGO - Garbage in Garbage out
techniques
data cleaning
data integration
data reduction
= Data Reduction is a techniques use to reduce the data size by aggregating, eliminating redundant features, or clustering for intances

data transformation
=data transformation means data are transformed or consilidated into forms appropriate for ML model training, such as normalization, may be applied where data are scaled to fall within a smaller range like 0.0 to 1.0
- Aggregation
- Feature type conversation
- Normalization
- Attribute / feature construction

data discretization
= data discretization techniques transform numeric data by mapping values to internal or concept labels. 
. It can be used to reduce the number of values of a given continois attribute by dividing the range of the attribute into intervals.
. Discretization techniques include
- Binning
- Histogram Analysis
- Cluster Analysis
- Decision-tree Analysis
- Correlation Ananlysis

prerequisites
= Python Libraries
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit Learn
= Mathematics
-Stastics
- Probability
- Calculus
- Linear Algebra

What is Feature Engineering
= Feature is an attribute or property shared by all of the indepedent units on which analysis or predication is to be done
= Feature Scaling is the process to create feature/ extract the features from existing features by domain knowledge to increase the performance of machine learning model.

= Major Process of feature engineering
- Brainstorming or testing features
- deciding what features to create
- creating features
- checking how the features work with model
- improving your features if needed
- go back to brainstorming / creating more feautes until the work is done

What is Varible
= A varible is any characteristic, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted
1. Numerical
>> A numerical variable is a varible where the measurement or number has a numerical meaning. eg(Age, Weight, Income, Percentage)
. Discretes - The value which can be counted as whole value(fixed) called discrete variable. 
eg (1,45,73,58 ), integer value. Not (56.4, 1.5, 73.6, 58.2)

. Continous - The values that contain range measurements called as continous variable. eg- (56.4, 1.5, 73.6, 58.2), the floating value.

2. Categorical
>> The values of a categorical variable are selected from a group of categories, also called labels. 
eg-( Grade, quality, days, product)
. Ordinal - Ordinal variable are categorical varible in which the categories can be meaningfully ordered.
like ( Grade - A, b, c, d ), (quality - Poor, bad, good, very good), (month- jan, feb, march...so on)

. Nominal- Nomical varible is like ordinal varible but there is nothing that indicate an intrinsic order of the labels and in principal.
- All labels are equal no order
- NO mathematical values
eg-(product - Laptop, bag, mouse), (language- python, java, php)

3. Dates and Times
>> Datetime varible can contain date, time, or data and time only

4. Mixed
>> The varible which contain numbers and categories (labels) called as mixed varible
